# monitor5
*Monitor5 is no longer in development and was replaced by Cam740 (https://github.com/alxcor/cam740).*

**Monitor5** may be used for diagnosis of Sinumerik 840D, Sinamics or Step7 systems connected via Ethernet.

It provides monitoring functions for Sinumerik CNC axes status signals, Sinamics Drives monitoring of drive status and a small Step7 scope.

- Alarm bit calculator (DB2)
- M function decode (in PLC)
- Axis monitoring (for Sinumerik 840D sl)
- NC->PLC functions monitoring
- Sinamics S or G drive monitoring
- Step7 mini oscilloscope


Project build on Qt5, using Snap7.

Provides axis monitoring for Sinumerik 840Dsl, drive monitoring for Sinamics G110, G120, S110, S120 drives

Special thanks to Stefania Corvin for code contribution to this project.
